Turns out OpenCV can not append frames to an existing video file. Every frame would need to be uploaded to memory every time I want to update the video.

Now I temporarily increase the storage of the environment, sync a folder in goes-stich/
with my s3 bucket using

    aws s3 sync s3://bucket-name/goes-conus .

rename to 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg... format using

    find . -name '*.jpg' | awk 'BEGIN{ a=0 }{ printf "mv %s %04d.jpg\n', $0, a++ }" | bash
    
then create the avi with ffmpeg

    ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i %06d.jpg 0001.avi
