Dodi is a mirrored polyhedron made with Neopixels, programmable LEDs. Most of the python files in this folder import master.py, and generate numpy arrays that represent what Dodi is going to do.
Dodi is powered by a raspberry pi. venv_requirements.txt shows the packages that dodi depends on. master2.py and master3.py are attempts at organizing the source code better.

Possible features to be add is a "sound reactive mode" where paths are dependent on a sound sensor. 
Another is to add a remote control that will cycle through patterns and maybe allow for variable intensities as well.

new patterns to test:
droplets_edge2.py 
blinker.py
pink_palace.py
chromatic_dance.py
candy_cane.py
snake_game.py

get rid of one if not both. rainbow_road is sine based anyway
color_whip.py
pulsate.py

old patterns to revisit:
